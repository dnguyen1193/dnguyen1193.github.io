	<h4>Who Am I?</h4>
	<p>Hi everyone! I'm currently a junior at Tufts University. I originally was a Cognitive and Brain Sciences major, but recently switched to Computer Science in the School of Arts and Sciences, deciding that the programming aspect of Computer Science was something I liked too much to let go of for other things. I'm also a pre-med student aspiring to someday potentially become a doctor and help others. Whether I'll actually get there or not, is a different story.</p>

	<p>If I decide not to go to medical school and don't want to be a doctor, I'm not sure what else I would do, but through my four years here at Tufts, I'm hoping I'll be able to figure it out. I've figured out a little about what I like, but have yet to decide what I can do with that yet.</p>

	<h4>What Do I Do? What Do I Love?</h4>
	<p>When I'm not in Halligan doing COMP40 with a partner, chances are, I'm hiding away in some library trying to catch up on the rest of my life, or preparing for the Chemistry group study sessions I hold every week. </p>
	<p>For fun? When I have time, I go to the Tufts Tae Kwon Do club practices - I'm currently a blue belt! I also really enjoy spending time with my friends! I'll often go try new foods with a friend or two and catch up with them there. Or we'll watch a movie or sing karaoke (badly). While I can be super lazy, I enjoy all sorts of physical activities - martial arts, rock climbing, kayaking, snowboarding - you name it. Chances are, I haven't done a lot of them, but would love to try it if I got the opportunity! I also LOVE amusement parks. Rollercoasters are scary, but a lot of fun! You might have to drag me on, but I promise I won't hate you afterwards. The only downside to that is I don't really enjoy waiting in lines...</p>
